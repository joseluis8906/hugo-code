    title: About Me
    icon: fas fa-user
    description:  
      "I'm a software engineer passionate about developing good-quality Go and Rust backend services, 
      but I’m also curious about some Javascript/Typescript frontend technologies, particularly Vue and Svelte. 
      \n\n
      In addition to designing and implementing highly responsive server-side software, I’m also responsible for 
      developing the application program interface (API) between the frontend and backend, mostly based on gRPC, 
      Thrift, AVRO or JSON REST applications. 
      \n\n
      I have worked with agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, and I deal perfectly with teamwork issues. 
      I’m 100% sure that two heads do think better than one."
